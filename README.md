# 🧮 Math Lab Programs – 1st & 2nd Semester (Python-Based)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python-based **Math Lab Programs** developed during the 1st and 2nd semesters. These programs are implemented using libraries like `NumPy`, `SymPy`, `Matplotlib`, and are primarily written and executed in Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 🔢 Matrix Rank (Linear Algebra)
- Multiple programs demonstrating how to calculate the rank of matrices
- Used `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`

### 🧩 Consistency of Linear Systems
- Checking consistency using matrix rank (`r(A) == r(AB)`)
- Solving systems using `numpy.linalg.solve`

### 🔁 Gauss-Seidel Method
- Iterative solution of equations with user-defined tolerance
- Good intro to numerical approximation

### 📈 Graph Plotting
- Sine and Cosine functions
- Cartesian plots (Line Plot)
- Polar plots:
  - Circle
  - Folium of Descartes
  - Cardioids (multiple forms)

### 🧮 Differentiation & Integration (Symbolic Math)
- Differentiating functions using `diff()` from `sympy`
- Using rules like product rule, u/v rule
- Basic definite/indefinite integrals using `integrate()`
